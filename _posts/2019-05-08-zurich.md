Zurich 1953 is for me *the* chess tournament. Incredible players. Incredible chess. Now annotated with
Leela.

The games are annotated using a
modified version of Chess Artist, using Leela Chess Zero for the opening and early middlegame, and
asmFish for the late middlegame and ending. The leela network used was 42202.
