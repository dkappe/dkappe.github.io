## Who We’re Playing

Whats does the field look like? From our own @jjosh (who spends way more time in TCEC chat than seems healthy):

> Leela chess zero, a mystery NN, Wasp, Senpai, and Tucano are currently confirmed for div 4 of S13.

They will probably add a few more engines into this division before the August 1 start date, so stay tune. before the August 1 start date, so stay tuned.

## What We’re Sending

This event marks the debut of the 20 block networks (256x20) from the test pipeline. It’ll be searching more slowly but with a lot more smarts. We’ve submitted 10161, which shows the best value head. If another network from the test pipeline can beat it in a slow time control setting, we’ll send that one.

## What’s at Stake

If we can place in the top two spots in division 4, will be able to advance to division 3 next season. Fingers crossed.
