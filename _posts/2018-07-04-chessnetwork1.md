## More Leela Vids

NM youtubing under Chessnetwork is on a bit of a Leela kick of his own. He’s got two interesting 
wins by two different ID’s, the first a very strategic Indian that Houdini 1.5a misunderstands. The second
against Stockfish 5 is a gambit in the Scotch.

I would like to see a few more wins on the black side, to be honest, but we’ll take what we can get.
