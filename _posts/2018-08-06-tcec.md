## Division 4, Just Past Halfway

Just past the halfway point, Leela’s fate is in her hands. With a win she could draw a half point ahead of Wasp for clear first. With a draw she could be once again tied with Wasp. With a loss she could drop into a tie for second place with DeusX, who had a very impresive win over Tucano. A lot of engines remain in striking distance with a lot of chess left to play.
