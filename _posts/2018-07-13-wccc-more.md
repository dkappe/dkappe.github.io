## More on the WCCC

First off a warm thank you to our Cyril Guyot (@Cyril on discord) who paid the late entry fee and convinced his employer, Western Digital, Research, to provide a monster machine with 8xV100’s to run leela. Cyril will be operating leela during the tournament. Hopefully some other community members will be there so he can take a bathroom break.

## Operator?

WCCC still has a human operator make moves on a board. Its all very punchcard and mainframe and has one expecting to play against Belle and Cray Blitz. Hopefully the remote connection and special ascii interface won’t lead to any snafus.

## Schedule

Today was testing. The tournament will run on Monday, July 16 through Thursday, July 19, or maybe it will all take place on Saturday — there are several conflicting schedules. The turnament is being held in Stockholm, Sweden.
