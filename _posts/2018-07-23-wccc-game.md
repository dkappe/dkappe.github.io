## Unwillingness to Simplify in a Difficult Position

[Editor's Note:

We tend to feature Leela wins on this blog. But sometimes you have to take
a look at your losses -- whether as a person or an engine.

IM William Paschall has been kind enough to analyze this loss at the WCCC with
black against TheGridGinko. A theme seems to emerge: while hanging on to your pieces
when you're up can be good, refusing to trade when your down can be bad.

Maybe looking at some of the parameters to make Leela play more conservatively
would be good, especially against stronger opponents.
