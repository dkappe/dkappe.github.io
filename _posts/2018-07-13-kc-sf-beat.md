## Leela Beats Stockfish

It's happened before, but when it happens on a big stage at a longer time control against a Stockfish on TCEC's beefy 43 core setup,
you have to sit up and take note.

King Crusher was at the scene in record time with a video.

Note that Leela was running on a remote machine with two 1080's (ti?). A rough estimate puts the [Leela Ratio](https://blog.lczero.org//2018/07/04/leela-ratio/) at around 0.5.
