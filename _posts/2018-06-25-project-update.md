## Project Update

Just a short update this week.

1. Tuning of hyperparameters in the test pipeline continues, along with parameters to lc0. An update on what has been learned in a future post.
2. Tweaking resignation continues. The idea is that once situation is hopeless for long enough in self play, the losing side resigns. Keeping the rate of resignations down to a low percentage and the rate of “false positives” — where a resignation happens in a drawn or winning position — to an even lower percentage.
3. There’s new time management in the works. The initial results in terms of elo gain are encouraging.
4. The rollout of lc0 and the new test pipeline will not happen this week or next.
