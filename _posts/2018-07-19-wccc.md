## Update, Day 4

### Round 7, Black vs Jonny

Some tactical blindness cropped up today. Leela dropped a queen to discovered
attack. It happens. Although Leela had some mate threats even material down,
Jonny was able to make progress and the team decided to resign.

Hopefully the 20b network will allow better communication
between different parts of the board and these kinds of blunders will be a
thing of the past.

### Summary

The summary of the tournament can be found
[here](https://icga.org/?page_id=2469). Leela finished seventh out of a field
of eight.

To recap: Leela's lack of opening book combined with some fairly strong engines
running on very beefy hardware led to some difficult games. Due to a family
emergency, we also lost access to 8xV100 hardware. Thanks to @TheAnswer for
jumping in with his 2x1080ti rig, and @TCECfan for jumping in as operator
on site. In any other tournament, a dual 1080ti rig would be pretty formidable,
but not in this one.

Better luck next year. I expect there will be several NN+MCTS engines
trying their luck.
