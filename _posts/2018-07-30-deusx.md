## DeusX by Albert Silver

Our own @ASilver has cooked up a net that will compete in TCEC S13 Div4. Here is the [interview](https://youtu.be/CpjvvcfbdR4) by one of the TCEC folks.

What we know:

1. It’s trained exclusively on human games.
2. It’s 128x10 in size.
3. It’s about even with Andscacs at TCEC CPU/GPU ratio.

So it will be a pretty rough customer. 

I’ve enjoyed the games from the net versus net matches I have been running lately. I really look forward to Leela meeting Deus X.
