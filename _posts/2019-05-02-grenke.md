Magnus Carlsen recently won the GRENKE Chess Classic by a good margin. I've annotated the games with a
leela flavor.

The games are annotated using a
modified version of Chess Artist, using Leela Chess Zero for the opening and early middlegame, and
asmFish for the late middlegame and ending. The leela network used was 42189.
