## Peaceful Agreement Reached

Yesterday, after a bit of a brouhaha on discord about the Deus X entry in TCEC,
cooler heads have prevailed. TCEC issued a set of [three statements](http://www.chessdom.com/statements-by-deus-x-and-leela-chess-zero-authors/) by Albert Silver,
the author of the Deus X NN, the Leela Chess authors, and the TCEC tournament director.

I thought the statement by the  Leela Chess authors was particularly gracious.
