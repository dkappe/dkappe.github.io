The surprise of Division 4 so far is Wasp 3.2, clear first by a half a point and with three NN scalps
to its credit. Leela is second and Deus X trails by another point. These three engines seem to make up the class of the field so far, but we’ve got more than half the tournament left to go.

One item of concern is that Leela is coming away with draws against some of the lowest ranked engines in the tournament. She needs to start closing the deal on the door mats.
