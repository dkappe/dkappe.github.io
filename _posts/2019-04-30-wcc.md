The 2018 WCC match berween Carlsen and Caruana has been annotated before, but I decided to add some
Leela flavor. The games are annotated using a
modified version of Chess Artist, using Leela Chess Zero for the opening and early middlegame, and
asmFish for the late middlegame and ending. The leela network used was 42138.
