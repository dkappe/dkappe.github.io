## Leela Accepted in WCCC

Leela Chess Zero has been accepted in the 2018 World Computer Chess Championships (WCCC). Looking at the [WCCC participant list](https://icga.org/?page_id=2365), we see we’re up against the following:
- Chiron
- Shredder
- Jonny
- Pauline
- Booot
- Hiarcs
- The Baron
- Komodo
- GridGinkgo

<!—more—>

There’s still two open spots, so we’ll keep an eye out. Chiron, Pauline and Leela won’t be using borrowed hardware (by which I assume a PC provided by the organizers).

After the disappointment of no GPU in TCEC, it’s exciting to get a chance  for Leela performing to her potential.
