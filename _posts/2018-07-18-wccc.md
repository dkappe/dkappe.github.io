## Update, Day 3

### Round 5, Black vs Shredder

The devs tinkered with a tiny opening book, so we got e4 instead of c4. Leela sans opening book proceeded to blunder into a sharp line in the Najdorf Opocensky variation after 11. f5! Shredder ran out of gas on itâ€™s kingside attack and Leela rallied. Play was sharp for a while until it ended quietly in a TB draw. Imagine what Leela could have done with an equal or better position. Right now she is no match for theory.
