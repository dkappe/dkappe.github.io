## Update, Day 3

### Round 5, Black vs Shredder

The devs tinkered with a tiny opening book, so we got 1. e4 c5. Leela sans opening book proceeded to blunder into a sharp line in the Najdorf Opocensky variation after 11. f5! Shredder ran out of gas on it’s kingside attack and Leela rallied. Play was sharp for a while until it ended quietly in a TB draw. Imagine what Leela could have done with an equal or better position. Right now she is no match for theory.

### Round 6, White vs The Baron

We had our hopes up for this one. Leela and TheBaron got into a closed sicilian that looked like something from the 1840’s. Leela proceeded to get her hooks into TheBaron, and after a break with e5, was trying to queen pawns. But it wasn’t quite enough. Draw.
