## Live Updates, Day 1

[Live Games](http://view.livechesscloud.com/7c104c94-c119-441e-a444-b0f22a1880d0)

### Round 1

Leela had white with Komodo (12 I assume). The game ended up in a TB draw (and there may have been a few opportunities
to claim a 3-fold around move 93), but the flag fell. 0-1.

### Round 2

White again against Booot. Leela is playing without a book, so she's vulnerable to better booked opponents. One can argue that
she got a suboptimal position out of the opening against Booot, with a doubled, isolated e-pawn. The result was a draw.
