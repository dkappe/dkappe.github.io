{Lc0 is an AI which has been criticized for being a poor endgame player. Here
is a position from an actual game, from which we will look at several
different analyses. This position is an interesting one from which to evaluate
Lc0, since the position is an extremely deep and subtle ending that
traditional engines have trouble with for several reasons. First, we can note
that there are too many pieces on the board initially for current tablebases
to provide a clear answer, though as we progress into the variations,
tablebase hits will occur and provide us with clarity. The other reasons are
all synergystic with one another: material stands at a significant imbalance
in the traditional point count, it is not a highly tactical position with only
one major piece for each side and no minor pieces, the pawn structure is
relatively locked (white will not be keen to push the f-pawn), and in fact,
white does in some variations threaten to set up a surprising, but known,
theoretical fortress (for example, if both pairs of the g- and h-pawns are
exchanged, and the f-pawn remains on f2, this is impenetrable). We know that
SF 8 and 9 are currently absolutely stronger than Lc0, though these
traditional engines are relatively weak positionally (compared to their
tactical strength) and Lc0 is known to be strong positionally (relative to its
tactical strength). All of the factors in the present position make it a
fertile ground for Lc0 to attempt to prove that it is not bad in "endgames"
per se. Here we will, at various positions, present analysis from up to 6
different sources (though not all of them for all positions): 1) Dvoretsky's
Endgame Manual by Mark Dvoretsky, from which I was introduced to this position
in my studies, and I reference it here, where it should be noted that
Dvoretsky introduces this position by mentioning that "V. Khenkin supplied a
detailed analysis for this ending."; 2) Stockfish 8; 3) Stockfish 9; 4)
Stockfish 9 with 6-man Syzygy Tablebases; 5) Lc0 449, searching an appropriate
fraction of the nodes of the Stockfish engines; 6) myself, as I offer that my
chosen truncation of the analysis for certain positions is relevant, even with
SF9 connected to tablebases, based on how complex this position actually is.} {
"Where does the rook belong, on e3 or f4? It turns out that both squares are
good when the black king is on d5; but the rook should stand on f4 (to protect
g4) while the black king remains on the kingside." -DEM} 56. Ra3 $2 {"In the
actual game, I. Dorfman undertook a premature transfer to e3."-DEM} ({"A draw

top choice, and at 3M nodes, SF8's evaluation doesn't distinguish between this

the top one} Ke5 57. Rf8 (57. Ra4 {"is also good." -DEM}) (57. Rf7 {according

not mentioned in DEM}) 57... Qe4+ 58. Kg1 Qc6 59. Rf4 $1 {emphasis that this
is an only move is mine. initially and at 400 nodes, Lc0 correctly concludes
that this is the best move. at 7M nodes, SF8 lists this as one of four moves,
all with -4.12 evaluations, though it's not listed as the number 1 move.} (59.
Rf7 $2 {this is an error with the different position of the queen, which is
also not mentioned by DEM and is the main variation we will be looking at. At

along with 2 other moves, in evaluation with the correct Rf4.} Qc4 (59... Qc1+

of these very highly. SF 8 seems to like both of these moves by 90M nodes,
though it doesn't really distinguish them as a win in its evaluation or from 2
other moves that draw.}) 60. Rf3 Qc1+ $1 {Lc0 highly prefers this only move
right from the start, whereas SF 8 requires about 33M nodes to slightly prefer
it over other moves.} 61. Kh2 Kd4 $1 {only move. at 16M nodes, SF 8 prefers
this move very slightly over other evaluations, at -4.41 or so, unfortunately
Lc0 doesn't seem to get this move, as it's 10th on its preference list} 62. Re3

SF8 doesn't give it any conclusive preference, Lc0 seems to prefer it strongly.

very strongly, preferring 63...Qb5 (and not seeing the repeat with 64...Qf1!)
so I would consider that incorrect. at 100M nodes, SF 8 doesn't seem to prefer
any move over any others.} (63... Qb5 {only repeats} 64. Re3 Qf1 $1 {SF 8 sees
quickly that this repeat is the best move in the position, though the
evaluation is only slightly better than other moves. Lc0 doesn't prefer this
move much at all at around 1000 nodes.} 65. Rf3) 64. Rf4+ Kd3 {Lc0 strongly
prefers this move right from even under 100 nodes} (64... Kc3 {these are the
only two moves that maintain the win here, and SF 8 shows a slight edge for
these two moves at 10M nodes, and it diverges a bit further around 50M nodes,

moves win as well, where here the f-pawn eventually drops}) 68... Kd3 $1 {
with this concession of the 4th rank, white has given up the possibility of
keeping the rook on f4, and black exploits this with a series of only moves to
head to the kingside. SF 8 shows no preference for any given move after 100M
nodes. Lc0 interestingly prefers this move between 97 and 136 nodes, though
after that and up to over 4000 nodes, it has a strong preference for ...Ke1}

move. Lc0 says this is absolutely the best here at under 1000 nodes!} 70. Re3+

white rook with the black king on the kingside holds true}) (67... Qb3 68. Rd4+

Lc0 449 to achieve 1082 nodes to recognize that its initial idea of Kh2 is not
best and change to Kg2. However, at 2000 nodes, it just seems to slightly
prefer Kg2, not recognizing that it's winning. at 1.6M nodes, SF8 doesn't
distinguish between Kg2 and Kh2, though at roughly 5M nodes, it sees that Kh2
is losing.}) 0-1
