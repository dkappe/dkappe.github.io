{"Where does the rook belong, on e3 or f4? It turns out that both squares are
good when the black king is on d5; but the rook should stand on f4 (to protect
g4) while the black king remains on the kingside." -DEM} 56. Ra3 $2 {"In the
actual game, I. Dorfman undertook a premature transfer to e3."-DEM} ({"A draw
could be reached by means of" - DEM} 56. Rf4+ $1 {at 180 nodes, this is Lc0's
top choice, and at 3M nodes, SF8's evaluation doesn't distinguish between this
at -4.15 evaluation and several other rook moves, though Rf4+ was listed as
the top one} Ke5 57. Rf8 (57. Ra4 {"is also good." -DEM}) (57. Rf7 {according
to my analysis, other moves work as well here, such as this one, though it's
not mentioned in DEM}) 57... Qe4+ 58. Kg1 Qc6 59. Rf4 $1 {emphasis that this
is an only move is mine. initially and at 400 nodes, Lc0 correctly concludes
that this is the best move. at 7M nodes, SF8 lists this as one of four moves,
all with -4.12 evaluations, though it's not listed as the number 1 move.} (59.
Rf7 $2 {this is an error with the different position of the queen, which is
also not mentioned by DEM and is the main variation we will be looking at. At
34M nodes, SF8 lists this incorrect move as the top move, though it's tied,
along with 2 other moves, in evaluation with the correct Rf4.} Qc4 (59... Qc1+
{is the only other move that also wins. unfortunately Lc0 doesn't rate either
of these very highly. SF 8 seems to like both of these moves by 90M nodes,
though it doesn't really distinguish them as a win in its evaluation or from 2
other moves that draw.}) 60. Rf3 Qc1+ $1 {Lc0 highly prefers this only move
right from the start, whereas SF 8 requires about 33M nodes to slightly prefer
it over other moves.} 61. Kh2 Kd4 $1 {only move. at 16M nodes, SF 8 prefers
this move very slightly over other evaluations, at -4.41 or so, unfortunately
Lc0 doesn't seem to get this move, as it's 10th on its preference list} 62. Re3
Qf1 $1 {both Lc0 and SF 8 tend to prefer this only move immedately. whereas
SF8 doesn't give it any conclusive preference, Lc0 seems to prefer it strongly.
} 63. Rf3 Qe2 {the most direct. at over 50k nodes, Lc0 doesn't consider this
very strongly, preferring 63...Qb5 (and not seeing the repeat with 64...Qf1!)
so I would consider that incorrect. at 100M nodes, SF 8 doesn't seem to prefer
any move over any others.} (63... Qb5 {only repeats} 64. Re3 Qf1 $1 {SF 8 sees
quickly that this repeat is the best move in the position, though the
evaluation is only slightly better than other moves. Lc0 doesn't prefer this
move much at all at around 1000 nodes.} 65. Rf3) 64. Rf4+ Kd3 {Lc0 strongly
prefers this move right from even under 100 nodes} (64... Kc3 {these are the
only two moves that maintain the win here, and SF 8 shows a slight edge for
these two moves at 10M nodes, and it diverges a bit further around 50M nodes,
though not a large difference in evaluation to other moves.}) 65. Kg2 Kd2 (
65... Kc2 {at over 100M nodes, SF 8 seems to show no preference for either of
these moves. at 855 nodes, Lc0 is not preferring either of them highly at all.}

moves win as well, where here the f-pawn eventually drops}) 68... Kd3 $1 {
with this concession of the 4th rank, white has given up the possibility of
keeping the rook on f4, and black exploits this with a series of only moves to
head to the kingside. SF 8 shows no preference for any given move after 100M
nodes. Lc0 interestingly prefers this move between 97 and 136 nodes, though
after that and up to over 4000 nodes, it has a strong preference for ...Ke1}
69. Ra3+ Ke4 $1 {with almost 200M nodes, SF 8 has no preference for any given
move. Lc0 says this is absolutely the best here at under 1000 nodes!} 70. Re3+
Kf5 $1 {SF 8 shows a slight preference for this move within 5-10M nodes. Lc0
shows an extremely strong preference for this move at under 1000 nodes!} 71.
Kh2 Kg4 $19 {and the initial analysis from DEM regarding the position of the
white rook with the black king on the kingside holds true}) (67... Qb3 68. Rd4+
Kc2 $19 {Lc0 seems to incorrectly prefer a king move to the e-file here still
at around 1000 nodes.} (68... Kc3 {SF 8 seems to start to slightly prefer this
move to the c-file at just under 100M nodes.}) (68... Kc1)) 68. Ra3 g5 $1 {
at 183M nodes, SF 8 shows no preference for this move at all. at 5000 nodes,
Lc0 doesn't give this move any credit.} 69. hxg5 Qxg5 $1 $19 {at 100M nodes,
SF 8 shows no preference for this move over any others. even at low numbers of
nodes, Lc0 claims this is absolutely the best move in the position.}) 59...
Qc1+ 60. Kg2 $1 $11 {emphasis that this is an only move is mine. this required
Lc0 449 to achieve 1082 nodes to recognize that its initial idea of Kh2 is not
best and change to Kg2. However, at 2000 nodes, it just seems to slightly
prefer Kg2, not recognizing that it's winning. at 1.6M nodes, SF8 doesn't
distinguish between Kg2 and Kh2, though at roughly 5M nodes, it sees that Kh2
is losing.}) 0-1
