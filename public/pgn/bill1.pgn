11. a4!? { At this point we leave main line book. Ng5 is almost universally played, but the AI is "thinking for itself".
Interestingly , stockfish also considers a4 a main candidate. Moves like a4, c5 and Qb3 are standard , but the question is do
we time for this ? } (11. Ng5 Nf6 12. Bf3 (12. f3)) 11... a5 { Classical thinking according to Dvoretsky in King's Indian is
that Black is playing on White's strong side here. Obviously in practical games such moves create chaos and play on both
sides. The strategic idea is that White's queenside structure is broken up. } 12. bxa5 { This position has been reached in
at least four Master level games. It seems 12. bxa5 is clearly best. This sort of idea has been known since the early 90's. White can eventually achieve a4 a5 or c5 breaks. Ironically, in another recent game from this set the Gull program with White in a similar position against Leela played the terrible b5 ?? closing the queenside and getting swamped with a standard kingside attack. } (12. b5?) 12... Rxa5 { This position now transposes back into some known territory theoretically !
Even in 1998 two experts doing battle ! } { Sokolov, Ivan - Smirin, Ilia, 1/2-1/2, Dresden zt 1.2, 1998, https://lichess.org/jx1vBq3p } (12... c5? { This is a motif in the 9...a5 variation, but doesn't seem to work here tactically. } 13. dxc6 bxc6 14. c5 { Firework tactics ignite by human standards, but every line seems clearly better for White. } 14... fxe4 (14... d5 15. exd5 cxd5 16. Bg5!! { [%csl Gd5][%cal Gc3d5,Gd1d5,Gg5e7,Gg5d8] } 16... Nf4 17. Bxf4 exf4 18. Rc1 Rxa5 19. Bb5 $16 { [%csl Rd5][%cal Gc5c8,Ga4a8] }) 15. cxd6 exf3 16. dxe7 Qxe7 17. Bxf3 $16) 13. Bd2 { This modest move only played in 1 game .... but a clear departure from the hackneyed Nd2-Nb3.
Another interesting line is 13. Ra3 !? } { Kazantsev, Renal Aleksandrovic - Booij, R. E., 1-0, FINJUB50/SF/06 (FIN), 2014, https://lichess.org/ED08xOmo } (13. Ra3!?)  (13. Nd2 { This would be main line book for a commercial chess program, but it's not necessarily better than the choice of Bd2. }) 13... Ra8 14. a5 { Gaining useful space before Black can lock it with b6. } 14... Nf4 15. Bf1 h6 (15... fxe4 { It's tempting to release the tension here and open the game but White has good defensive resources. } 16. Nxe4 Bg4 17. Ra3 { [%cal Ga3h3] } 17... Nf5 18. h3 Bxf3 19. Qxf3 Nd4 20. Qd1 $14 { Black has trouble continuing to attack without his white squared bishop for example. }) 16. c5! {[#] This is actually brilliant and thematic. } 16... dxc5 17. Bxf4 exf4 18. e5 {[#] This position actually reminds me of old Bayonet attack lines I played in the early 90's with 10.c5 , before 10.Re1 became popular. } 18... g5 { This seems like a situation where White's "understanding" of the position is much deeper than Black. For example....19.Nd2 is not on the radar. } 19. Nd2! Re8 (19... Ng6 20. Nc4 Re8 { This would transpose to the game. }) 20. Nc4 Ng6 21. Nb5! {[#] The striking thing about White's play is that it's thematic...not tactical like a typical engine. It's almost human like in style of play. ID440 shows very good understanding of several factors including space advantage and coordination of the the forces. Also noticable is that it is not materialistic. } 21... Nxe5 22. d6 { Again very thematic....all of White's pieces are working...seems almost more strategic than tactical. Like a very strong human grandmaster. } 22... cxd6 23. Nbxd6 Re6 { Black is hanging on by a thread. The main problem is the lack of coordination in the position. } 24. Rb1!? {[#] This move was surprising and must be based on deep calculation. On the surface it seems Qb3 was more obvious. The nice feature of this move , it simply gets the rook off the long diagonal. The King's Indian bishop is a classic "ghost" piece. } (24. Qb3 { [%cal Gb3g8,Gb3b7,Ga1d1] } 24... Kh7 25. Nxf5 Nxc4 26. Nxg7 Nxa5 {[#] This is a very complicated line and probably Leela did well to avoid the crazy complications here. } 27. Nxe6 (27. Rxa5 Rxe1 28. Rxa8 Rxf1+ 29. Kxf1 Kxg7 30. Qxb7+ Bxb7 31. Rxd8 $16) 27... Nxb3 28. Rxa8 Qd2 29. Nf8+ Kg7 30. Re2 Qc1 31. Rxc8 Nd2 32. Ne6+ Kg6 33. Rxd2 Qxd2 34. Nxc5 $16) 24... Kh7 25. Nxc8 Qxd1 26. Rexd1 Rxc8 27. Nxe5 Bxe5 28. Rxb7+ {[#] Reaching by force a technical ending that is probably indefensible. The a6 pawn is brutally strong. Rook and opposite color bishop endings are notoriously difficult for the defending side. } 28... Kg6 29. Bc4 { [%csl Gc4,Rc5][%cal Ga5a6] } 29... Rd6 30. Rxd6+ Bxd6 31. a6 Kf6 32. a7 Ke5 33. Rd7! { Stronger than the natural Kf1. } 33... Ra8 { Black is condemned to passive defense now. The only question is can Black somehow exchange off all the pawns and sacrifice the bishop for the a7 pawn ? } 34. Kf1 Rc8?! { Strange move that does nothing. Pawn moves seem like a better hope. } (34... h5 35. h4! gxh4 { [%csl Gh4,Gh5,Gf5,Gf4] } (35... g4 36.

Bxh5 { This line for example...just enough for White to win. })) 35. Ke2 h5 36. f3 h4 { Seems a bit strange to fix pawns on dark squares....but Black has few useful moves. } 37. h3 { Now Black has no chance to trade any pawns realistically. } 37... Re8 38. Kd3 { White steadily improving position of the King. } 38... Ra8 39. Rg7 { Again the principle of 2 weaknesses. } 39... Kf6 40. Rb7 Ke5 41. Bb3 { Useful waiting move. } 41... c4+ { Desperation. } 42. Kxc4 g4 { Black isn't going anywhere. } 43. Ba4 Rc8+ 44. Kb5 Rf8 45. Kb6 Rg8 46. Bc6 { Now White is clearly winning. Instructive how White mobilized his passed pawn and simultaneously froze the doubled pawns on the king side. } { [%csl Ga8][%cal Gc6a8] } 46... gxh3 47. gxh3 Ke6 48. Rh7 Bb4 49. a8=Q Rxa8 50. Bxa8 { The rest is easy. } 50... Kf6 51. Rb7 Bd2 52. Kc6 Ke6 53. Rb5 Kf7 54. Kd5 Kg7 55. Ke6 Be3 56. Kxf5 Bd2 57. Kg5 Kf7 58. Kxh4 Bc1 59. Kg5 Bd2 60. h4 Bc3 61. h5 Be1 62. h6 Bc3 63.

Kc5 84. Qf2+ Kc6 85. Qf3+ Kc7 86. Ke4 { Wasting time. } 86... Kd6 87. Kd4 Ke6 88. Qd1 { Again wasting time. } 88... Kf5 89. Kd5 Kf4 90. Qa4+ Kg3 91. Ke4 Kg4 92. Kd4 { Very strange move. } 92...
