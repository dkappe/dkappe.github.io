This is the blog for official communications and information about the Leela Chess Zero project.

### More Information

This is an adaptation of GCP's Leela Zero repository to chess, using Stockfish's position representation and move generation. (No heuristics or prior knowledge are carried over from Stockfish.)

The goal is to build a strong UCT chess AI following the same type of techniques as AlphaZero, as described in "Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm."

We will need to do this with a distributed project, as it requires a huge amount of computations.
